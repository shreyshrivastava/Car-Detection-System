Custom YOLOv5 Car Detection
This project demonstrates the process of setting up, training, and using a custom YOLOv5 model specifically for car detection. Leveraging YOLOv5's high-speed and accurate object detection capabilities, we trained the model on a custom dataset of car images to recognize vehicles in various contexts.

Project Overview
In this notebook, we:

Set up the environment by installing the required dependencies, including specific versions of PyTorch and Torchvision.
Clone the YOLOv5 repository and configure the workspace for custom training.
Import essential libraries for data processing and visualization.
Train a YOLOv5 model on a custom dataset of car images.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and visualize the detection results on test images.
Getting Started
To use this notebook:

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including specific versions of PyTorch (1.8.1) and Torchvision (0.9.1), as specified in the setup cells.
Load your own custom car images or any dataset containing car images for training and testing.
